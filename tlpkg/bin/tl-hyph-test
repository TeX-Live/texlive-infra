# Method for testing hyph-utf8 before committing to TL.
# The idea is to make a new TL tree, unzip the hyph-utf8.tds.zip there,
# build TL from the modified (not committed) tree,
# install from that TL into another temp dir.
# Thus checking all the steps that will happen after commit.
# It's complicated.

# Usage:
tmpdir=/home/texlive/hyphtest # used in TLhyphtest.pro (used below).

## Initial setup for first time:
##mkdir $tmpdir # e.g., , could be anywhere
##cd $tmpdir
## 
## Get svn checkout of Master tree; need real checkout for the build below.
##svn -q co svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk/Master # takes an hour
## If on tug, slightly faster:
##time nice -19 svn -q co file:///home/svn/texlive/trunk/Master
#
# 
# After the first time, when the checkout already exists:
if false; then # better to run these one at a time
  cd $tmpdir
  rm -rf inst catdump.pl     # clean up from last time
  cd Master
  ~karl/bin/svri      # get rid of any local changes
  time svn update -q  # get updates made in the meantime (could take an hour)
  svn status          # make sure it's completely clean
  # 
  # Unzip the new hyph-utf tree in our temp checkout.
  cd texmf-dist
  ls -l $CTAN/install/language/hyph-utf8.tds.zip # ensure new file on ctan
  unzip -q -o !$                                 # overwrite All
  # In that unzip command, -o overwrites All symlinks with the regular files.
  #   On tug.org, CTAN=/home/ftp/tex-archive.
  #   This unzip won't remove any no-longer-distributed files;
  #   deal with that below.
  # 
  # Unzip new tlpsrc files (without leading directory):
  cd ../tlpkg/tlpsrc
  # Again, overwrite all:
  unzip -q -o -j ../../texmf-dist/source/generic/hyph-utf8/tlpsrc.zip
  #
  # No tlpsrc should have any non-ASCII characters.
  # If so, fix them & report:
  ~karl/bin/nonascii *.tlpsrc
  #
  # Back to top level of $tmpdir (the one with the ./Master subdir).
  cd $tmpdir
  #
  # Remove the tlpsrc.zip.
  rm Master/texmf-dist/source/generic/hyph-utf8/tlpsrc.zip
  #
  # See what we've got.
  svn status Master # if new package/file has been added, set newpkg/file below
  svn diff Master >/tmp/sdh # review changes, especially in tlpsrc files
  #
  # When ready, run this script:
  ./Master/tlpkg/bin/tl-hyph-test >/tmp/tht.out 2>&1; echo $?
  cat /tmp/tht.out
  # Make sure output is good, no errors building formats, etc.
  # 
  # If any files are "present but not covered" (in the "file
  # consistency" check), check if they are in the original
  # $CTAN/install/language/hyph-utf8.tds.zip:
  # - If so, then it's a bug in the tlpsrc generation; fix/report.
  # - If not, then it's an intentional removal in the new release.
  #   rm them from our working directory, and svn rm
  #   them from the TL dev directory where we'll eventually commit.
  #   (The usual method for determining when files have been removed
  #   doesn't work here because hyph-utf8 is split into numerous TL
  #   packages.)
  #
  # Once it all works, can install hyph-utf8 with ctan2tl [p] as usual;
  #   copy any changed .tlpsrc (or other) files to dev, and
  #   don't commit in hyphtest, so additions and removals will be correct.
  # Also, good to run a test build right after committing since there is a
  #   good chance of failure, despite all the testing:
  #force_rebuild=true cron.trunk # or cron.pretest, if during pretest
  # 
  # To clean up in $tmpdir, after commit to regular tree:
  cd $tmpdir
  rm -rf inst tmp catdump.pl
  svn update Master # to get changes just made
  svn revert --depth infinity Master >/tmp/svri
  rm `svn status Master | sed -n 's/\?//p'` # remove "?" files (new ones)
  svn status Master  # ensure clean
